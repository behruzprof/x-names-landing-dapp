  {
    question: "What are Bictory Domains?",
    answer: `Bictory Domains is a distributed, secure, and extensible naming system for Web3, based on the L1 and L2 blockchains. Bictory Domains empowers users to map human-readable names to blockchain identities and resources such as Multiversx addresses and identities, IPFS hashes, texts, socials, web URLs and so much more. Rather than strings of long-difficult-to-remember addresses, the Bictory Domains offers a much more secure and straightforward method to transfer and receive value using memorizable names. That is to say, users can send crypto assets to “bictory.mvx” instead of “erd123xxy3vejda23dwa000…”—the L1 and L2 chains power bictory domains for Web3. Ownership of a domain name is provable on the blockchain and can be transferred, bought, or sold on a decentralized secondary market. This offers a secure and decentralized way to manage website domains. Bictory Domains aims to focus on the distribution and provision of names to aid users in navigating and surfing the Web faster and better. Bictory Domains is not designed to replace or compete with DNS; it seeks to make trade and exchange of crypto assets easier and avoid the cumbersome process of copying and pasting long public addresses with the risk of error while utilizing dapps.
Similar to the Internet DNS, Bictory Domains will run on a hierarchical system, allowing domain name owners to take control of any sub-domains—for example, bictory.solana can create sub-domains like nft.bictory.solana or wallet.bictory.solana. The possibilities of Bictory Domains are endless; they could even pass for Non-fungible tokens since the registered Bictory Domains can be transferred and sold in a secondary market like any other NFT. Bictory Domains will also allow users to connect their domains to social media accounts as identification verifiers and set up protocols associated with their domains.
